Description
  I have developed a front-end application which would help users list and browse all launches by SpaceX program.
  For this the values are given by API paths.
  Firstly home.component is developed where the visual is present.
  The CSS file is also included.
  To get the API path values, I have used service and resolver files. 
  Here service file is used to get the data from API.
  The fuction calls in Service return the Observable instances.
  Here resolver is used to load the data at first time load.
  We subscribe at the component file, this is because to receive the data before the actual html loads and give exceptional values.
  
Files

  * home --> home.component.html
